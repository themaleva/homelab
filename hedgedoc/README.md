# Hedgedoc

## What is it?
HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor.

You can use it to easily collaborate on notes, graphs and even presentations in real-time. All you need to do is to share your note-link to your co-workers and theyâ€™re ready to go.
