# Nginx Proxy Manager

## What is it?
NPM is a simple nginx proxy service to allow you to route services on your service via a domain. If running this on a local server, note that you'll also need a dns server - I use Pi-Hole for this.

## Setup
All steps are covered here: https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/#quick-setup

Should that page move, the defaults are below:

Admin URL: <your_server_ip>:81

## Default Admin User:
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
